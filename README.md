# npm-ui

I very quickly tried to make scaffolding for a UI on top of npm/yarn, like [Sunil Pai](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/948559739826376704) suggested.

## Todo

* [ ] stream output correctly
* [x] get possible scripts (/scripts)
* [x] run script (/scripts/run/:script)
* [x] get installed dependencies (/dependencies)
* [x] install dependency
* [x] remove dependency
* [ ] search for dependency (https://github.com/algolia/npm-search)
* [ ] UI
